## Understanding of the mission

The mission of the code is to output a matrix representing a finite forest. Each element in the matrix represent an area in the forest, it has 4 states: empty;tree;burning;lighting. 
Despite how it relates to actual world, the program's mission is to initialize the matrix and modify it according to some rules. To make the coding easier, I plan to use multi-demensional arrays as a scratchpad buffer for complicated outputs, as I realized how they make things easier in task 'spiral.c' and 'boxes.c' from lab03.
